# F4-ESC-FC-stack
I designed my own F4 stack (not from scratch), made way too many mistakes I probably didn't notice. STM32F405GT6 as the main processor, and STMG071 as the ESC processors, AT765E OSD, ICM-20689 Gyroscope, Barometer, and a lot more wired with blood, sweat and tears.

This repository isn't for the world to see, but for that kid who thought he couldn't, the one who spent hours flying his drone, the one who stared at the PCB of PC's and his Arduino board, amazed and in awe. This is for that kid, to tell him that he finally did it, it isn't beautiful, and the chances it works are pretty low, it probably will make a true electrical engineer rage with the anger of a thousand suns, but atleast all the wires are connected, and he tried his best.

Hi, I'm Upkirat, and this is my F4 ESC+FC stack combo, a project I initially started in November 2024, but always postponed it, because I just didn't understand it. Jumping from plugging in designated wires to my Arduino, to designing my own PCB for a DRONE, wasn't the easiest transition I would say. I didn't give myself a chance to slowly ease into this field, rather I tried to explore as much knowledge was available, figuring out different parts, and if AI wasn't there to help me, this would still be a project collecting dust on my TO-DO list. 

For this design I would definately not take credit for coming up with it, instead I relied mainly on 2 repositories here on GitHub, understoof them, recreated them, and hopefully made something that made sense.

these designs help me understand the different components, the process, and basically guided me on this process. My greatest challenge with this project wasn't the wiring, the PCB design or anything else, but it was simply learning what made a flight controller and ESC for a drone, what all did it need, what features, how does it function, WHY does it function, as this isn't something being done for the first time, countless companies have made so many versions that are way better (because they were made by someone who actually knows how this stuff works). 

But for me, whatever the result was for this, I know that I have learned, I have worked hard, and I am proud of my result...so here it is
