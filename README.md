# F4-ESC-FC-stack
I designed my own F4 stack (not from scratch), made way too many mistakes I probably didn't notice. STM32F405GT6 as the main processor, and STMG071 as the ESC processors, AT765E OSD, ICM-20689 Gyroscope, Barometer, and a lot more wired with blood, sweat and tears.

This repository isn't for the world to see, but for that kid who thought he couldn't, the one who spent hours flying his drone, the one who stared at the PCB of PC's and his Arduino board, amazed and in awe. This is for that kid, to tell him that he finally did it, it isn't beautiful, and the chances it works are pretty low, it probably will make a true electrical engineer rage with the anger of a thousand suns, but atleast all the wires are connected, and he tried his best.

Hi, I'm Upkirat, and this is my F4 ESC+FC stack combo, a project I initially started in November 2024, but always postponed.
